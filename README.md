**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**
Building a machine learning model - "LSTM" that identifies an anomalous trajectory of objects moving in space (Vehicles, missiles).

This project comprises three stages (Each folder represents a step):

1. **Data Anomaly Generation :**
   - Description: Creation of anomalies within an existing data repository.

2. **Vehicle Track Database Creation and LSTM Modeling:**
   - Description: Establishment of a database using vehicle tracks, incorporating both normal and anomalous routes. Various LSTM models 
   are developed for analysis.

3. **Missile Trajectory Simulation:**
   - Description: Simulation of missile trajectories and generation of LSTM models. Results are stored in a folder named "missile data" within Google Drive.
